# All the Variables that were used in the analysis

**Variables in the dataset:**

* **id:** This likely represents a unique identifier for each user within the application.
* **measure:** This variable indicates the type of health measurement recorded. In the code, it primarily focuses on "weight" but could potentially hold other measures.
* **measure_value:** This variable stores the actual numerical value of the health measurement, likely the user's weight in this case.
* **systolic:** This variable might be present if blood pressure is another measured health metric. It represents the systolic blood pressure value.
* **diastolic:** This variable might be present if blood pressure is measured. It represents the diastolic blood pressure value.

**Timestamps:**

* **log_date:** This variable might be present if the code explores timestamps associated with each health measurement record. It would likely indicate the date and time the measurement was recorded.

**Data Quality Variables:**

* **measure_value (null values):** The code investigates the presence of missing values (null) within the "measure_value" variable, indicating missing weight entries.

**Derived Variables:**

* **frequency:** This variable is calculated within the code and represents the number of times a specific measure or value appears in the data.
* **percentage:** Another calculated variable, representing the percentage of occurrences for a specific measure or value relative to the total number of entries.

**Descriptive Statistics:**

* **mean:** This variable, calculated for weight, represents the average weight of users within the dataset.
* **median:** This variable, calculated for weight, represents the middle value when all weight entries are arranged in order from lowest to highest.
* **mode:** This variable, calculated for weight, represents the most frequent weight value within the dataset.
* **standard deviation:** This variable, calculated for weight, represents the average amount of deviation from the mean weight.
* **variance:** This variable, calculated for weight, represents the squared standard deviation, another measure of data spread.
* **percentile:** This variable represents different percentile values (e.g., 10th, 50th, 90th percentile) calculated for weight. It helps understand the distribution of weight values within the data.
* **minimum_value, maximum_value:** These variables represent the lowest and highest weight values recorded within the dataset after potential data cleaning.

**Data Cleaning:**

* **duplicates:** The code identifies and potentially removes duplicate records within the data to ensure data integrity.

**Binning:**

* **bucket:** This variable represents weight ranges created by the code to analyze the distribution of weight values within specific weight categories.
